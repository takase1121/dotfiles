# dotfiles


My dotfiles. Has a lot of pitfalls so be careful when applying.

I will try to list the programs I used.

- xterm
- openbox
- qterminal (Replaced with xterm)
- starship
- xava
- picom (`next` branch)
- mpv 
- xwinwrap [(my own fork)](https://github.com/takase1121/xwinwrap)
- some more that I forgot.

# Notes
- In case you haven't realised, I use chezmoi.
- `CTRL-X` replaces `CTRL-C` to emit `SIGINT`. This is intentional
- You must edit the filename in `manage_wp` to use it yourself. Mine is `blue.mp4`

# TODO
- locker (planning to write my own)
- tabbed for xterm (I should have followed csdvrx to install tabbed as default)
